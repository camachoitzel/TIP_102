Problem 1: NFT Name Extractor
You're curating a large collection of NFTs for a digital art gallery, and your first task is to extract the names of these NFTs from a given list of dictionaries. Each dictionary in the list represents an NFT, and contains information such as the name, creator, and current value.

Write the extract_nft_names() function, which takes in this list and returns a list of all NFT names.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

def extract_nft_names(nft_collection):
    pass
Example Usage:

def extract_nft_names(nft_collection):
    pass

# Example usage:
nft_collection = [
    {"name": "Abstract Horizon", "creator": "ArtByAlex", "value": 5.4},
    {"name": "Pixel Dreams", "creator": "DreamyPixel", "value": 7.2},
    {"name": "Future City", "creator": "UrbanArt", "value": 3.8}
]

nft_collection_2 = [
    {"name": "Crypto Kitty", "creator": "CryptoPets", "value": 10.5},
    {"name": "Galactic Voyage", "creator": "SpaceArt", "value": 6.7}
]

nft_collection_3 = [
    {"name": "Golden Hour", "creator": "SunsetArtist", "value": 8.9}
]

print(extract_nft_names(nft_collection))
print(extract_nft_names(nft_collection_2))
print(extract_nft_names(nft_collection_3))
Example Output:

['Abstract Horizon', 'Pixel Dreams', 'Future City']
['Crypto Kitty', 'Galactic Voyage']
['Golden Hour']

Problem 2: NFT Collection Review
You're responsible for ensuring the quality of the NFT collection before it is displayed in the virtual gallery. One of your tasks is to review and debug the code that extracts the names of NFTs from the collection. A junior developer wrote the initial version of this function, but it contains some bugs that prevent it from working correctly.

Task:

Review the provided code and identify the bug(s).

Explain what the bug is and how it affects the output.

Refactor the code to fix the bug(s) and provide the correct implementation.

def extract_nft_names(nft_collection):
    nft_names = []
    for nft in nft_collection:
        nft_names += nft["name"]
    return nft_names
Example Usage:

nft_collection = [
    {"name": "Abstract Horizon", "creator": "ArtByAlex", "value": 5.4},
    {"name": "Pixel Dreams", "creator": "DreamyPixel", "value": 7.2}

Problem 3: Identify Popular Creators
You have been tasked with identifying the most popular NFT creators in your collection. A creator is considered "popular" if they have created more than one NFT in the collection.

Write the identify_popular_creators() function, which takes a list of NFTs and returns a list of the names of popular creators.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

def identify_popular_creators(nft_collection):

Problem 4: NFT Collection Statistics
You want to provide an overview of the NFT collection to potential buyers. One key statistic is the average value of the NFTs in the collection. However, if the collection is empty, the average value should be reported as 0.

Write the average_nft_value function, which calculates and returns the average value of the NFTs in the collection.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.
